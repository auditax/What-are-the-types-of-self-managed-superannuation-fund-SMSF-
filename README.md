# What-are-the-types-of-self-managed-superannuation-fund-SMSF-
I believe your question may be what are the different ways of managing a superfund? Because there is only 1 type of SMSF...
You can either have a 'Managed Superfund' which is an APRA regulated superfund which most people us. There are many names in the industry such as Rest Super, Industry Super etc. However, some people choose to manage their investments themselves through a Self Managed Superfund (SMSF). There very strict rules governing both of them though by ASIC and ATO.
